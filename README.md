# AnarchyTools
Swift build tools circa 1980s.

The Anarchy Tools are:

1.  A collection of minimal, simple, composeable, *separate* programs.
2.  Easy to reason about, hack, and extend.
3.  Unopinionated.
4.  Magic-free.
5.  Motivated by the needs of real software the contributors are trying to build.
